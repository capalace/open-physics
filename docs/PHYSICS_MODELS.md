# Open Physics — Physics Model Catalog

> **Status:** Foundational physics specification
> **Purpose:** Define the equation-based physical models that the client-side simulation engine may implement.

## 1. Philosophy

Open Physics is an equation-driven visual simulation environment, not a general-purpose real-world physics engine.

Each simulation defines:

```text
State + Parameters + Conditions
        ↓
Physical Laws / Equations
        ↓
Numerical Solver
        ↓
Updated State
        ↓
Visualization
```

The equations below are the baseline model catalog. They are grouped by the product's content navigation, not by implementation order.

A model may be simplified by explicitly fixing assumptions such as constant gravity, ideal materials, ideal gases, geometric optics, or negligible air resistance.

## 2. Common Mechanics Models

## 4. Waves

### 4.1 Basic Wave Relations

```text

f = 1/T
ω = 2πf
k = 2π/λ
```

```text
y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ)
```

### 4.2 Superposition and Interference

```text
I = I₀ cos²θ
```

## 6. Thermal Physics

### 6.1 Temperature and Thermal Energy

Temperature is a state variable; microscopic particle motion may be visualized as a model rather than a literal molecular-scale simulation.

Heat transfer by temperature difference can use:

```text
Q = mcΔT
```

Latent heat:

```text
Q = mL
```

### 6.2 Ideal Gas

```text
PV = nRT
```

```

For an ideal monatomic gas:

```text
U = 3/2 nRT
```

### 6.4 Heat Transfer

Conduction can use a simplified one-dimensional model:

```text
Q̇ = kAΔT/L
```

Radiative heat transfer can use:

```text
P = εσAT⁴
```

or, for net exchange with surroundings:

```text
P_net = εσA(T⁴ - T_surroundings⁴)
```

## 7. Modern Physics

```

```

Probability density:

```text
P(x) = |ψ(x)|²
```

```text
Δx Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

For introductory visualization, quantum models should generally visualize probability amplitudes/densities rather than pretend that a classical particle has a definite hidden trajectory.

### 7.5 Quantum Tunneling

For a simple rectangular barrier, the transmission probability may be modeled approximately using the relevant energy/barrier parameters. The exact approximation should be selected according to the regime being visualized rather than treated as a universal formula.

```text
N(t) = N₀e^(-λt)

```

### 7.7 Semiconductors

The semiconductor section should initially use simplified educational models rather than a full device-physics simulator.

Candidate models include:

```text
Band gap
Carrier concentration
p-n junction
Diode I-V characteristic
LED photon energy
Solar-cell energy conversion
```

The exact equations will be specified when semiconductor simulation is implemented.

## 9. Modeling Rules

1. **Every implemented phenomenon must state its assumptions.**
2. **Equations are the source of behavior; animations should not fake the result.**
3. **A physical law must be independent from its numerical solver.**
4. **Units must be explicit and consistent internally.**
5. **Simplification is allowed when the assumptions are clear.**
6. **A model should expose the quantities that are useful for visualization and experimentation.**
7. **Content presets configure models; they do not duplicate model implementations.**
8. **Do not implement a more complicated physical model merely because it is more realistic if the simpler model better expresses the intended concept.**
